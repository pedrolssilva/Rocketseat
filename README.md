# OmniStack 8.0 - tindev
This is a small project that uses technologies like React, React Native, and NodeJs to build the "tindev", an application that connects developers through github API and can make like and dislike if the bio is good for both. This learning was only possible because the Rocketseat (https://rocketseat.com.br/) gave a week class to introduce this stack to developers who want to learn more about these technologies.
